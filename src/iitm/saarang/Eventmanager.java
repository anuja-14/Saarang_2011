        "Nritya Prerana- Classical Dance\n\nDance starts as a hobby, becomes a habit and finally an addiction. Words are insufficient to describe how this hedonistic endeavor can transform the dancerâ€™s body and intellect. Traditional Indian classical dance goes one step further in cleansing the soul. In India, nritya is synonymous with sadhana, the pathway to attaining spiritual salvation or moksha. It elevates us to an eternal state of bliss, away from the mundane earthly limitations to a divine plane of uninterrupted felicity where the dancer immerses himself/herself in the chasm of pure bliss and becomes one with his sadhana, nritya. Dance is also the culminating point of â€˜bhakthiâ€™ or ultimate devotion when the devotee forgets the surroundings and loses control over his senses in the most controlled manner.\n\nDance does as much to the appreciator as it does to the performer. Just like how according to Sankhya,  the dynamic dance of the life-giving prakrithi enchants the purusha and transforms him, a good dancer weaves a magic spell on the spectators who then become enthralled, uplifted and inspired.Yes, dance is the inspiring force within all of us. The 'prerana'. The eternal persuasive encouraging force which enlightens us.\n\nThis Saarang, as we embark on a journey to art in its purest and unadulterated form, join us and enthrall us with your graceful splendor.We present to you, \"nritya prerana\" @ Saarang 2010!"
